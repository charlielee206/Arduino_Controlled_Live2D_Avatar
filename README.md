# Arduino Controlled Live2D Avatar
Work in progress.</br>
Android app that reads serial data via USB OTG cable, and interprets the value into Live2D character movement in Unity.</br>
Thus, making it an IRL Vtuber display for other arduino robot projects.</br>
Doesn't have to be an anime face, could also be used for a responsive character display in unity.</br>


Imagine Pathfinder from Apex Legends, the Securitrons from Fallout New Vegas, or Karen from spongebob.
